Nmap Scanner Pretty (Go)

Overview

Nmap Scanner Pretty is a terminal-based Go program using nmap to scan hosts and ports, producing colorful, emoji-rich, and terminal-friendly outputs. Results are exported in XML, JSON, and a Log.txt file.

This tool is intended for educational, legal, and penetration testing practice only.

Features

Supports IP addresses, hostnames, URLs, and CIDR ranges.

Generates colored terminal output with emojis for open/closed/filtered ports.

Saves scan results as XML, JSON, and Log.txt.

Configurable nmap arguments, scan timeout, and output directory.

Compatible with Termux, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
